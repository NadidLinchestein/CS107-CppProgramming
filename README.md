# CS107 C++ Programming

My Solutions to CS107 C++ Programming course at Saylor Academy.

In this course, we will learn the mechanics of editing and compiling programs in C++. We will begin with a discussion of the essential elements of C++ programming: variables, loops, expressions, functions, and the string class. Then, we will cover the basics of object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, templates, exceptions, and file manipulation. We will then review function and class templates and the classes that perform output and input of characters to/from files. This course will also cover namespaces, exception handling, and preprocessor directives. In the last part of the course, we will learn some slightly more sophisticated programming techniques that deal with data structures such as linked lists and binary trees.

This course includes the following units:

Unit 1: Introduction and Setup
Unit 2: Structuring Program Code
Unit 3: Working with Simple Data Structures
Unit 4: Object-Oriented Programming
Unit 5: Advanced Concepts

Course Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- compile and execute code written in C++

- define and use functions, arrays, struct, unions, and enumerations
- write C++ applications using principles of object-oriented programming
- write templates and manipulate files
- translate simple word problems into C++
- perform debugging and fixing of common C++ errors
- manage memory appropriately, including proper allocation/deallocation procedures.
