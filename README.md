# CS107 C++ Programming

My Solutions to CS107 C++ Programming course at Saylor Academy.

In this course, we will learn the mechanics of editing and compiling programs in C++. We will begin with a discussion of the essential elements of C++ programming: variables, loops, expressions, functions, and the string class. Then, we will cover the basics of object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, templates, exceptions, and file manipulation. We will then review function and class templates and the classes that perform output and input of characters to/from files. This course will also cover namespaces, exception handling, and preprocessor directives. In the last part of the course, we will learn some slightly more sophisticated programming techniques that deal with data structures such as linked lists and binary trees.
